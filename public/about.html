        <h1>About InstaLearn</h1>
        <p>InstaLearn is a web application designed to quickly generate multisensory study materials for learning concrete Portuguese vocabulary. Upon searching for a word, the system generates a card containing the Portuguese translation, an image representing the word, and an audio recording of its pronunciation. InstaLearn uses <b>Google’s Translation API</b> to provide translations and audio recordings, and <b>Bing’s Image Search API</b> to retrieve images.</p>
    
        <p>Since InstaLearn relies on third-party APIs, the results may not always be 100% accurate. While we cross-referenced the premade content produced by the Translation API, we cannot guarantee that every result will align with the context intended by the user. Additionally, to prioritize quick results that can be exported to study tools like Anki, we display only the first image result and do not allow users to select alternative images. As such, the image may not always be fully accurate, especially for more abstract terms, and image quality may vary across the app.</p>
    
        <p>Please use InstaLearn at your discretion.</p>
